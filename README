Build Instructions

You must first satisfy the build dependencies of LiberTI.

| Library/Tool               | Purpose                                       |
|----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------|
| GNU Autotools              | Automatic build scripts                       |
| ANSI C Compiler            | (Prefer GCC or Clang) Source compilation      |
| GNU Scientific Library     | Complex math calculations and data structures |
| Simple DirectMedia Layer 2 | Graphics and threading                        |

On Debian GNU/Linux and derivatives, you can install these with the following
command:

    # apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake libgsl0-dev libsdl2-dev

After the dependencies are installed, you can build LiberTI as follows:

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make

If you wish to install LiberTI to the system, you can run the following:

    # make install

Disclaimer
----------

This project was created independently by David McMackins for Delwink, LLC as a
**replacement** for LibreCalc's existing TI emulator. LiberTI is not (yet)
officially endorsed or supported by LibreCalc.

Hacking
-------

We prefer the GNU coding style for C with a strict limit of 79 columns in the
source code. Indentations are two spaces, and tab characters are eight
spaces. It is polite to use a tab character any time eight spaces would be used
in an indentation, but not required.

To submit a patch, [submit your diff to Delwink][2], or use GitHub's pull
request system.
