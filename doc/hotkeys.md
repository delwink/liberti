LiberTI Hotkeys
===============

LiberTI is designed for use on both PCs and GNU/Linux-based portable
calculators. While PC users can create and use custom skins for point-and-click
interfaces to LiberTI, a keyboard interface is provided mostly for the ease of
constructing portable LiberTI calculators.

Because of the keyboard interface's focus on portable calculators, its
interface can be somewhat strange to PC users. This document describes the
various hotkeys in LiberTI, and you can assume most other keys work as
expected, while some keys are completely ignored (such as function keys not
bound to a mode).

Modifier keys are written in Emacs documentation style. `C-e` means
`Ctrl+E`. `C-E` means `Ctrl+Shift+E`.

Alpha Mode
----------

As a side note, holding the shift key is also considered 'alpha mode'. It's
designed to make it easy to type text strings into LiberTI. While typing `s`
normally will insert `sin(`, holding shift while typing `s` will insert `S`.

Hotkey List
-----------

- `C-a`: `Ans` (the answer to the last entry)
- `c`: `cos(`
- `C-d`: `° (*(π/180))`
- `e`: `e` (constant)
- `C-e`: `E (*10^)`
- `i`: `i` (constant)
- `C-p`: `π` (constant)
- `s`: `sin(`
- `t`: `tan(`
- `$`: `→` (stores value to left into variable to right)
- `C--`: `-` (inserts minus at the beginning without inserting `Ans`)
